# Memory Game done with react following the Udemy Advanced developer course

The master branch contains my own solution approach.


## Things I learned about publishing the app to github pages

1. follow https://medium.com/@_mariacheline/deploy-create-react-app-project-to-github-pages-2eb6deda5b89
2. set credential store to wincred https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8984#issuecomment-165722062
3. use git bash, otherwise cmd throws this error:
```
git-upload-pack '.': git-upload-pack: command not found
```
4. if gh-pages once failed, to run it again successfully, its cache must be cleared https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-modern-library-boilerplate/issues/15#issuecomment-372165120
